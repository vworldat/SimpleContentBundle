{#
Twig Content Container
Extends a given base template or doesn't extend at all if an empty string is
provided. Includes the given contentlocation inside a block named "content".

The block name is hardcoded because twig has not included dynamic block names

TODO: variable content block name.
possible to inject variable for the content block?
requires dynamic blocks

other solution would be pre-generated container templates

#}

{# extending the base template #}
{% extends baseTemplate %}

{# hardcoded block name "content" #}
{% block content %}
    {% include "c33sSimpleContentBundle:Content:_content_renderer_markdown.html.twig" %}
{% endblock %}
